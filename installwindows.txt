How to set up Sheep and Classi on Windows

A very short incomplete instruction:

[Written by Jan Aman, with addenda by Malcolm MacCallum]

Install Cygwin [from http://www.cygwin.com/] on your Windows
computer. You will need quite a lot of the stuff including svn, make
and probably ssh. [A full list of what is needed is given on the
reduce-algebra web site listed below.]

Install latest version of Reduce from sourceforge.net, use svn.
The PSL version is more useful than the CSL version.

To do this:

1. First download Reduce from http://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.net/
using the svn command described in the general installation
instructions, i.e.
svn co https://reduce-algebra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/reduce-algebra reduce-algebra
I have not checked if the prepackaged versions work (Jan advises that
he cannot recommend the prepackaged October 2010 version: several
problems of importance to Sheep/classi were fixed later.)

2. In your reduce-algebra/trunk directory run
./configure --with-psl

3. To build Reduce you should now be able to just type
make

The files will be in 
reduce-algebra/trunk/pslbuild/i686-pc-windows
where 
i686-pc-windows
will be replaced by the combination of machine and OS type configure
diagnoses for your system.]

Unpack Sheep and Classi files from shp062win.tar.gz available
on request or at pccge20b.ugent.be:~jan/sheep (or
www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~mm/shp)

Go into sheep/062/psl and fix symbolic links to fit your computer,
if directory sheep is placed in parallel with reduce-algebra the
existing links will be OK. Edit make-bare-psl if you have different
directory structure. You may also need to edit the directory names
in sheep/062/psl/psl, sheep/062/psl/make-bare-psl and
sheep/062/.pslrc to fit your system. (And later similarly edit .shprc
and .reducerc)

Run make-bare-psl.

Go to 062/slsrc/psl and modify directories and DOMAINNAME in
startlisp and in startreduce.

Go 'make slisp'.

Start slisp and check the value of SYSTYPE!* , if wrong data
change in startlisp (startreduce) or in systyp.sl.

It may be a good idea to look at logfiles in 062/plog.

Go to 062/shpsrc/psl and 'make sheep' and to clasrc/psl
and 'make classi'.

If things are OK 'make classi' and 'make rclassi' in sheep/062
should work quicker.

The stensor makes do not currently work correctly, apparently due to
problems in calling sparsify, but do leave correct images with the
names stensor.img and rtensor.img. Rename these to pstensor.img and
prtensor.img and move them to the img directory and all should work
fine.

To start the working versions use scripts in sheep/bin, edit
e.g. classi to provide correct location of the sheep directory
(if not D:/sheep). Link it to sheep, slisp, rclassi, rsheep
and rslisp and place it in a directory in your PATH (e.g.
/usr/local/bin) or include sheep/bin in your PATH or start
with a Windows icon. (Switches -o , -s and -n are not flexible
as only Cygwin but not Windows images follow symbolic links)

[Alan Barnes has reported a problem under Windows 7 (and Vista?)
with the classi version but not the rclassi version. We have not seen
this problem yet.]

If you use provided images instead of recompiling it is
possible to fix some minor problems by adding commands like
(SETSYSTYPE 'DOMAIN "ugent.be") in 062/sclassi.ini, ssheep.ini
and sslisp.ini to fix SYSTYPE!* and MSEARCHLIS!*.

For CSL the Reduce interface will not work properly yet and
as redirection of standard input or output seem not to work
logfiles can not be created and checked and also makefiles
can be used only if you manually give some commands to CSL to
load files etc.

In order to test Classi with clasrc/psl/alltst you must
first go into /bin/csh, this applies also to 062/mkdisttape.

Report problems!
