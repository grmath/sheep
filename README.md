SHEEP, CLASSI and STENSOR - Symbolic Computation System

SHEEP is a symbolic computation system for tensor calculus in general relativity, but can be used in solid and fluid mechanics. Sheep was written largely by Inge Frick in Stockholm in the late 1970s to early 1980s. It was used the LISP Algebraic Manipulator (LAM) by R.A. dâ€™Inverno developed in the late 1960s. SHEEP was initially implemented in the assembly language MACRO-10 for DEC-10 computers, then in LISPs. The latest version is based on the Portable Standard LISP.
